Currently I have about 30 tabs open in the browser on my phone. Quite
a bunch of them I have open because I want to read the article in the
future, already have read the article and want to reread or act on it,
or a combination of the above. In this article I list the open tabs
(and some notes) so I can close them on my phone, but still have a
reference to them.
