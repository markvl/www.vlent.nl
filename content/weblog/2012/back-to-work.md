Thanks to a
[tweet](http://twitter.com/#!/pypi/status/154164095321518080) by
[@pypi](http://twitter.com/pypi) I discovered collective.backtowork,
created by [Patrick Gerken](https://github.com/do3cc).

The package, of which
[version 0.5.2](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.backtowork/0.5.2)
was released today, is small but can be very useful. It shows a
notification when a Zope instance has started.

It currently only works on Linux systems. If you know how to do
something similar for OS X or Windows, please fork
[the code](https://github.com/collective/collective.backtowork) and
add the necessary incantations.

Oh, my Zope instance is ready, so I'm back to work...
