Several Pythonistas switched to a static blog this year. If you are
also looking into static blog engines, give
[Acrylamid](http://posativ.org/acrylamid/) a go.

Examples of persons that went static are
e.g. [Alex Clark](http://blog.aclark.net/yes-this-blog-is-now-powered-by-pelican.html),
[Daniel Greenfeld](http://pydanny.com/my-new-blog.html) and
[Tarek Ziad√©](http://ziade.org/2012/03/05/moving-to-pelican/). What
these guys have in common is that they all use
[Pelican](http://getpelican.com/).

You could follow their example and use Pelican---and it's probably a
good choice---but I recommend you also at least have a look at
Acrylamid. It is written in Python, quite easy to get up and running,
it offers all a blog needs (articles, tags, lists of articles, pages
and feeds) and the author quickly responds to issues, pull
requests and questions. You can write your content in (amongst others)
[reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) and
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). The
templates can be [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) or
[Mako](http://www.makotemplates.org/).

Acrylamid is already great. But it is also under active development so
it will even get better!

Disclaimer: Since today I use Acrylamid for this blog (more about that
in the next article:
[migrating to Acrylamid](/weblog/2012/10/01/migrating-to-acrylamid/)). I
also contributed some code to the project. So I might be a bit
biased...
