On 19 February I held a presentation for my colleagues about
distributed version control systems (DVCS). My main goal was to inform
them on what I think is the next logical step in source control.

My presentation can be found
[on slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/markvl/distributed-version-control-systems-3270524),
a summary can be read on
[Maurits' weblog](http://maurits.vanrees.org/weblog/archive/2010/02/presentations-at-zest#mark-dvcs).

A small disclaimer: my original plan was to create an implementation
agnostic introduction to DVCS for my co-workers at
[Zest](http://zestsoftware.nl/). However, while creating the
presentation I found it easier to compare DVCS to Subversion.

Also note that the last couple of slides talk about
[git](http://git-scm.com/) and
[git-svn](http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-svn.html)
specifically. This is because my colleagues were interested in the way
I currently use git to work on our projects. The `git-ext-svn-clone`
command I refer to in slide 39 can be found on
[github](http://github.com/markvl/git-svn-clone-externals).
