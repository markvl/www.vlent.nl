What? A photo without a Zest t-shirt?

Before any of my colleagues
[keelhauls](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keelhauling) me for not
wearing my Zest shirt for the conference photo: sorry, but I just
wasn't able to. My suitcase got left behind in Amsterdam and at the
moment I'm waiting for it to arrive. With a bit of luck I'll have it
this evening...

**Update:** United indeed delivered my suitcase this evening! Yay!
