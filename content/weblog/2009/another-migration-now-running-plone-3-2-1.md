A quick fix became an upgrade. :)

Since I started to blog, I wanted to register it on Planet Plone. What held me back was the fact that the RSS feed showed my Plone username as the creator and not my full name. I never got around to fix this. Since I had some time at hand anyway, I decided to set this straight. And while I'm in [an upgrading mood](/weblog/upgrade-ubuntu-8.04-to-8.10 "Upgrade Ubuntu 8.04 to 8.10"), why not also upgrade the site to Plone 3.2.1?

As expected it went smoothly. But hey, that's one of the advantages of having a simple site (almost no customizations, little content). ;-) I'll also try to get my blog listed on Planet Plone soon now I've got the RSS sorted out.
