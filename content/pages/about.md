Hi there! My name is Mark van Lent and this is my personal weblog.

On this weblog I (almost exclusively) write about the things I come
across while coding. As a result most articles are related to
developing web applications.

# Python, Plone and Django

During my Computer Science study at the Delft University of
Technology, I used a number of programming languages like Assembler
(for the [PDP-11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11)),
[Modula-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modula-2), but also the more
commonly used languages like C and Java. Part-time jobs and hobby lead
me to code in ColdFusion, Perl, PHP and
[LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/).

While writing my master's thesis in 2004 someone gave me a book about
Python with the words “you might also like this language.” And I did!
After solving a couple of
[Python Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/) riddles and
writing scripts to automate some tasks, I decided to make writing
Python code my day job.

That's how in January 2007 I ended up with
[Zest Software](http://zestsoftware.nl/) where I got introduced to the
world of [Zope](http://zope.org/) and
[Plone](http://plone.org/). Since 2009 I also worked on several
[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) projects. Between February
2011 and July 2013 I was an employee of
[Edition1](http://www.edition1.nl/) and the technical lead for their
Plone based content management system, SwordFish. As of August 2013 I
am a developer at [Fox-IT](https://www.fox-it.com/nl/).

# This site

This website started in the Nineties as a static HTML site that
listed my bookmarks. When I got the vlent.nl domain in 2003 it had
already been upgraded to a PHP site.

A couple of years later, in 2008, I migrated to Plone to
[eat my own dog food](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food). Two
years later I changed my mind again and figured that a blog doesn't
need a complete content management system and decided to go with a
more lightweight, Django based, website.

The 2012 edition of this website is more 'back to basics.' I realised
that I do not even need a dynamic site at all for this weblog. So now
I'm using [Acrylamid](http://posativ.org/acrylamid/) to build this
static blog out of articles written in Markdown. And if you are
interested: the source used to generate this site can be found in a
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/markvl/www.vlent.nl).

For a more visual version of the history of this site, go to the
[memory lane](/memory-lane).

# Contact

If you want to get in touch with me, you can use (in random order):

  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mvlent)
  * [Google+](https://plus.google.com/+MarkvanLent/)
  * [LinkedIn](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/markvanlent)

Or you can send an email to "mark" at this domain name.

## PGP

If you want to send me an email and want to encrypt it, you can use my
public [PGP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy) key to
do so. You can:

   * Have PGP/GnuPG import it from a key server, e.g “`gpg --recv-keys
     0x2144528D88110619`”.
   * Download [the key from this site](/0x2144528D88110619.key) and import it,
     e.g. “`wget -qO- https://www.vlent.nl/0x2144528D88110619.key | gpg --import`”.

Either way, make sure that the downloaded key has this fingerprint:

    1FFA 3F2D 26D6 B7FB AED7  FE5F 2144 528D 8811 0619

(To see the fingerprint, use e.g. “`gpg --fingerprint
0x2144528D88110619`”.)
