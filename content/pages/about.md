Hi there! My name is Mark van Lent and this is my personal weblog.

As a technical consultant and programmer for
[Edition1](http://www.edition1.nl) I spend my days either giving
customers advice about their website, or actually implementing their
sites. Most of these websites are based on
[SwordFish](http://www.swordfish.nl/), a content management system
built using [Plone](http://plone.org/), or the web framework
[Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/). Lucky me: both are written in
[Python](http://www.python.org/), my favorite programming language.

My weblog is (almost exclusively) about the things I come across while
working on projects. As a result most entries are related to
developing (web) applications.

# Python, Plone and Django

During my Computer Science study at the Delft University of
Technology, I had to use a number of programming languages, ranging
from for instance Assembler for the PDP-11 and C, to Java. During this
time I had jobs that required me to write in PHP and ColdFusion.

While writing my master's thesis in 2004 someone gave me a book about
Python with the words “you might also like this language.” And I did!
After solving a couple of
[Python Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/) riddles and
writing scripts to automate some tasks, I decided to make writing
Python code my day job.

That's how in January 2007 I ended up with Zest Software where I got
introduced to the Zope and Plone world and since 2009 I also got to do
Django projects. As of February 2011 I'm an employee of Edition1 and
the technical lead for SwordFish, the CMS we use to build for most of
our projects.

# This site

The evolution of this website reflects my personal development. It
started in the Nineties as a static HTML site listing my bookmarks. It
was already a PHP site when I got the vlent.nl domain in 2003.

A couple of years later, in 2008, I migrated to Plone to
[eat my own dog food](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food). In
2010 I changed my mind again and figured that a blog doesn't need a
complete content management system and decided to go with a more
lightweight, Django based, website.

The 2012 edition of this website is more 'back to basics'. I realised
that I don't need a dynamic site at all for this weblog. So now I'm using
[Acrylamid](https://github.com/posativ/acrylamid/) to build this
static blog out of articles written in Markdown.

For a more visual version of the history of this site, go to the [memory lane](/memory-lane).
