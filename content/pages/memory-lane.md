Care to take a stroll down memory lane? This is how this site looked
like through the years.

In 2003 I registered the domain name `vlent.nl`. The first version of
this site was written in PHP and looked something like this:

![PHP version, 2003--2007](/images/vlent/2003-2007-php.png "2003--2007, PHP")

After working with [Plone](http://plone.org) for more than a year, I
used that CMS to create a new version. The event that triggered me to
resurrect my site was the fact that I was going to the Plone
Conference of 2008 and I needed a blog to create
[summaries of the talks I attended](/weblog/tag/ploneconf2008). This
was the result:

![Plone, 2008--2009](/images/vlent/2008-2009-plone.png "2008--2009, Plone")

In 2009 I created a new theme for the site, basically a modified
version of the
[Keep it simple theme](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plonetheme.keepitsimple):

![Plone, 2009--2010](/images/vlent/2009-2010-plone.png "2009-2010, Plone")

I did not change the theme until I switched to
[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) in May 2010. I went back to
blue again:

![Django, 2010](/images/vlent/2010-2010-django.png "2010, Django")

That version didn't last very long. About two months later I wanted
something with more colour and I created a new theme based on the
[Logistix theme](http://www.freecsstemplates.org/preview/logistix/):

![Django, 2010--2012](/images/vlent/2010-2012-django.png "2010--2012, Django")

I started working on a new look in the second half of 2011 but that
turned out to become a completely new site using
[Acrylamid](https://github.com/posativ/acrylamid/). When it went live on
October 1<sup>st</sup> in 2012, it looked like this:

![Acrylamid, 2012--2016](/images/vlent/2012-acrylamid.png "Acrylamid, 2012--2016")

After changing the fonts and some tweaking, this is what it looked
like as of mid 2016:

![Acrylamid, 2016--?](/images/vlent/2016-acrylamid.png "Acrylamid, 2016--?")
